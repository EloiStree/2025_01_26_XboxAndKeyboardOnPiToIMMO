# Xbox and Keyboard on Raspberry Pi for iMMO

This code enables you to use controllers and keyboards as input devices to play games with 4 to 50+ players. I call this an **Integer Massive Multiplayer Online** game: **iMMO**.

This solution was successfully tested during the **Global Game Jam 2025** ðŸ˜Š.

On a Raspberry Pi, Xbox controllers are recognized as generic HID (Human Interface Device) controllers. These scripts convert input from controllers and keyboards into **Index Integer values (`<ii`)**, which can then be used in your game logic.

I hope this helps!
